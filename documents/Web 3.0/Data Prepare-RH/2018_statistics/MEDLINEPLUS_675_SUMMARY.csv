You can get an abscess almost anywhere in your body. When an area of your body becomes infected, your body's immune system tries to fight the infection. White blood cells go to the infected area, collect within the damaged tissue, and cause inflammation. During this process, pus forms. Pus is a mixture of living and dead white blood cells, germs, and dead tissue. </p> <p>Bacteria, viruses, parasites and swallowed objects can all lead to abscesses. Skin abscesses are easy to detect. They are red, raised and painful. Abscesses inside your body may not be obvious and can damage organs, including the brain, lungs and others. Treatments include drainage and antibiotics. </p>"

They, along with the tonsils, are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. The adenoids and tonsils work by trapping germs coming in through the mouth and nose.</p> <p>Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.</p> <h3>What are enlarged adenoids? </h3> <p>Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.</p> <h3>What causes enlarged adenoids?</h3> <p>Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.</p> <h3>What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?</h3> <p>Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose. Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth.

It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. It can infect both men and women. Women can get chlamydia in the cervix, rectum, or throat. Men can get chlamydia in the urethra (inside the penis), rectum, or throat.</p> <h3>How do you get chlamydia?</h3> <p>You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has the infection. A woman can also pass chlamydia to her baby during childbirth.</p> <p>If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it.</p> <h3>Who is at risk of getting chlamydia?</h3> <p>Chlamydia is more common in young people, especially young women. You are more likely to get it if you don't consistently use a condom, or if you have multiple partners.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of chlamydia?</h3> <p>Chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. People with chlamydia who have no symptoms can still pass the disease to others. If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with an infected partner.</p> <p>Symptoms in women include</p> <ul> <li>Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smell</li> <li>A burning sensation when urinating</li> <li>Pain during intercourse</li> </ul> <p>If the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal pain, pain during sex, nausea, or fever.</p> <p>Symptoms in men include</p> <ul> <li>Discharge from your penis</li> <li>A burning sensation when urinating</li> <li>Burning or itching around the opening of your penis</li> <li>Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common)</li> </ul> <p>If the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and/or bleeding.</p> <h3>How is chlamydia diagnosed?</h3> <p>There are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. For women, providers sometimes use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia.</p> <h3>Who should be tested for chlamydia?</h3> <p>You should go to your health provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia, or if you have a partner who has a sexually transmitted disease. Pregnant women should get a test when they go to their first <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/prenatalcare.html'>prenatal visit</a>.</p> <p>People at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year:</p> <ul> <li>Sexually active women 25 and younger</li> <li>Older women who have new or multiple sex partners, or a sex partner who has a sexually transmitted disease</li> <li>Men who have sex with men (MSM)</li> </ul> <h3>What are the complications of chlamydia?</h3> <p>In women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/pelvicinflammatorydisease.html'>pelvic inflammatory disease</a> (PID).

You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics, or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused.</p> <p>To prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up.

This can include</p> <ul> <li><strong>Unhealthy eating habits,</strong> such as eating lots of bad fats. One type, saturated fat, is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Another type, trans fat, is in some fried and processed foods. Eating these fats can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol.</li> <li><strong>Lack of physical activity,</strong> with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol.</li> <li><strong>Smoking,</strong> which lowers HDL cholesterol, especially in women.

Read about symptoms and what can help.","<h3>What is chronic fatigue syndrome?</h3> <p>Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.</p> <h3>What causes chronic fatigue syndrome?</h3> <p>Scientists don't know what causes CFS. There may be more than one thing that causes it. It is possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.</p> <h3>Who is at risk for chronic fatigue syndrome?</h3> <p>Anyone can get CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women have it more often that adult men. Whites are more likely than other races to get a diagnosis of CFS, but many people with CFS have not been diagnosed with it.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome?</h3> <p>CFS symptoms can include</p> <ul> <li>Severe fatigue that is not improved by rest</li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html'>Sleep problems</a></li> <li>Post-exertional malaise (PEM), where your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activity</li> <li>Problems with thinking and concentrating</li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/chronicpain.html'>Pain</a></li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/dizzinessandvertigo.html'>Dizziness</a></li> </ul> <p>CFS can be unpredictable.

There are no tests for it, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of CFS. He or she will do a thorough medical exam, including</p> <ul> <li>Asking about your health history and your family's medical history</li> <li>Asking about your current illness, including your symptoms. Your doctor will want to know how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life.</li> <li>A thorough physical and mental status exam</li> <li>Blood, urine or other tests</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome?</h3> <p>There is no cure or approved treatment for CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms. You, your family, and your health care provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes the most problems, and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html'>good sleep habits</a>. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.</p> <p>Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful.

So if you exercise regularly, you can lower your risk of getting these eye and vision problems.</li> <li><strong>Wear sunglasses.</strong> <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sunexposure.html'>Sun exposure</a> can damage your eyes and raise your risk of <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/cataract.html'>cataracts</a> and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/maculardegeneration.html'>age-related macular degeneration</a>.

This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease.</li> <li><strong>Know your other risk factors.</strong> As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know you risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.</li> <li><strong>If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections.</strong> Wash your hands well before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them, and replace them when needed.</li> <li><strong>Give your eyes a rest.</strong> If you spend a lot of time using a computer, you can forget to blink your eyes and your eyes can get tired. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.</li> </ul> <h3>Eye Tests and Exams</h3> <p>Everyone needs to have their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening in school or at their health care provider's office during a checkup. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.</p> <p>Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.</p> <p>The exam includes several tests:</p> <ul> <li>A visual field test to measure your side (peripheral) vision. A loss of peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma.</li> <li>A visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away, to check on how well you see at various distances</li> <li>Tonometry, which measures your eye's interior pressure. It helps to detect glaucoma.</li> <li>Dilation, which involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye, including the <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/retinaldisorders.html'>retina</a>, macula, and optic nerve.</li> </ul> <p>If you have a <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/refractiveerrors.html'>refractive error</a> and are going to need <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/eyewear.html'>glasses or contacts</a>, then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.</p> <p>At what age you should start getting these exams and how often you need them depends on many factors. They include your age, race, and overall health. For example, if you are African American, you are at higher risk of glaucoma and you need to start getting the exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should get an exam every year. Check with your health care provider about if and when you need these exams.</p>"

Learn about these tiny insects, such as how to tell if you have them, and how to treat it.","<h3>What are head lice?</h3> <p>Head lice are tiny insects that live on people's heads. Adult lice are about the size of sesame seeds. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a dandruff flake. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears.</p> <p>Head lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/bodylice.html'>body lice</a> and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/pubiclice.html'>pubic lice</a>. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of head lice?</h3> <p>The symptoms of head lice include</p> <ul> <li>Tickling feeling in the hair</li> <li>Frequent itching, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites</li> <li>Sores from scratching. Sometimes the sores can become infected with bacteria.</li> <li>Trouble sleeping, because head lice are most active in the dark</li> </ul> <h3>How do head lice spread?</h3> <p>Lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They spread by close person-to-person contact. Rarely, they can spread through sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Personal hygiene and cleanliness have nothing to do with getting head lice. You also cannot get pubic lice from animals. Head lice do not spread disease.</p> <h3>Who gets head lice?</h3> <p>Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. This is because young children often have head-to-head contact while playing together.</p> <h3>How do you know if you have head lice?</h3> <p>A diagnosis of head lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. Because they are very small and move quickly, you may need to use a magnifying lens and a fine-toothed comb to find lice or nits.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for head lice?</h3> <p>Treatments for head lice include both over-the-counter and prescription shampoos, creams, and lotions. If you want to use an over-the-counter treatment and you aren't sure which one to use or how to use one, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. You should also check with your health care provider first if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you want to use a treatment on a young child.</p> <p>Follow these steps when using a head lice treatment:</p> <ul> <li>Apply the product according to the instructions. Only apply it to the scalp and the hair attached to the scalp. You should not use it on other body hair.</li> <li>Use only one product at a time, unless your health care provider tells you to use two different kinds at once</li> <li>Pay attention to what the instructions say about how long you should leave the medicine on the hair and on how you should rinse it out</li> <li>After rinsing, use a fine-toothed comb or special ""nit comb"" to remove dead lice and nits</li> <li>After each treatment, check your hair for lice and nits. You should comb your hair to remove nits and lice every 2-3 days. Do this for 2-3 weeks to be sure that all lice and nits are gone.</li> </ul> <p>All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary. If an over-the-counter treatment does not work for you, you can ask your health care provider for a prescription product.</p> <h3>How can I prevent head lice?</h3> <p>There are steps you can take to prevent the spread of lice. If you already have lice, besides treatment, you should</p> <ul> <li>Wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer</li> <li>Soak your combs and brushes in hot water for 5-10 minutes</li> <li>Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where you sat or lay</li> <li>If there are items that you cannot wash, seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks</li> </ul> <p>To prevent your children from spreading lice:</p> <ul> <li>Teach children to avoid head-to-head contact during play and other activities</li> <li>Teach children not to share clothing and other items that they put on their head, such as headphones, hair ties, and helmets</li> <li>If your child has lice, be sure to check the policies at school and/or daycare. Your child may not be able to go back until the lice have been completely treated.</li> </ul> <p>There is no clear scientific evidence that lice can be suffocated by home remedies, such as mayonnaise, olive oil, or similar substances.

The general recommendations for sleep are</p> <ul> <li><strong>Newborns:</strong> 16-18 hours a day</li> <li><strong>Preschool-aged children:</strong> 11-12 hours a day</li> <li><strong>School-aged children:</strong> At least 10 hours a day</li> <li><strong>Teens:</strong> 9-10 hours a day</li> <li><strong>Adults (including the elderly):</strong> 7-8 hours a day</li> </ul> <p>During puberty, teenagers' biological clocks shift, and they are more likely to go to bed later than younger children and adults, and they tend to want to sleep later in the morning. This delayed sleep-wake rhythm conflicts with the early-morning start times of many high schools and helps explain why most teenagers do not get enough sleep.</p> <p>Some people think that adults need less sleep as they age. But there is no evidence to show that seniors can get by with less sleep than people who are younger. As people age, however, they often get less sleep or they tend to spend less time in the deep, restful stage of sleep. Older people are also more easily awakened.</p> <p>And it's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short might not get enough of certain stages of sleep.</p> <p>If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep, including quality sleep, ask yourself</p> <ul> <li>Do you have trouble getting up in the morning?</li> <li>Do you have trouble focusing during the day?</li> <li>Do you doze off during the day?</li> </ul> <p>If you answered yes to these three questions, you should work on improving your sleep.</p> <h3>What are the health effects of not getting enough sleep?</h3> <p>Sleep is important for overall health. When you don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation), it does more than just make you feel tired. It can affect your performance, including your ability to think clearly, react quickly, and form memories. This may cause you to make bad decisions and take more risks. People with sleep deprivation are more likely to get into accidents.</p> <p>Sleep deprivation can also affect your mood, leading to</p> <ul> <li>Irritability</li> <li>Problems with relationships, especially for children and teenagers</li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/depression.html'>Depression</a></li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/anxiety.html'>Anxiety</a></li> </ul> <p>It can also affect your physical health. Research shows that not getting enough sleep, or getting poor-quality sleep, increases your risk of</p> <ul> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/highbloodpressure.html'>High blood pressure</a></li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/heartdiseases.html'>Heart disease</a></li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html'>Stroke</a></li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/kidneydiseases.html'>Kidney disease</a></li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html'>Obesity</a></li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/diabetestype2.html'>Type 2 diabetes</a></li> </ul> <p>Not getting enough sleep can also mean that you don't get enough of the hormones that help children grow and help adults and children build muscle mass, fight infections, and repair cells.</p> <p>Sleep deprivation magnifies the effect of alcohol. A tired person who drinks too much alcohol will be more impaired than a well-rested person.</p> <h3>How can I get better sleep?</h3> <p>You can take steps to improve your sleep habits. First, make sure that you allow yourself enough time to sleep. With enough sleep each night, you may find that you're happier and more productive during the day.</p> <p>To improve your sleep habits, it also may help to</p> <ul> <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day</li> <li>Avoid <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/caffeine.html'>caffeine</a>, especially in the afternoon and evening</li> <li>Avoid nicotine</li> <li><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/exerciseandphysicalfitness.html'>Exercise</a> regularly, but don't exercise too late in the day</li> <li>Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed</li> <li>Avoid large meals and beverages late at night</li> <li>Don't take a nap after 3 p.m.</li> <li>Relax before bed, for example by taking a bath, reading or listening to relaxing music</li> <li>Keep the temperature in your bedroom cool</li> <li>Get rid of distractions such as noises, bright lights, and a TV or computer in the bedroom. Also, don't be tempted to go on your phone or tablet just before bed.</li> <li>Get enough sunlight exposure during the day</li> <li>Don't lie in bed awake; if you can't sleep for 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing</li> <li>See a doctor if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sleepdisorders.html'>sleep disorder</a>, such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/insomnia.html'>insomnia</a> or <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sleepapnea.html'>sleep apnea</a>. In some cases, your doctor may suggest trying over-the-counter or prescription sleep aid. In other cases, your doctor may want you to do a sleep study, to help diagnose the problem.</li> </ul> <p>If you are a shift worker, it can be even harder to get a good sleep. You may also want to</p> <ul> <li>Take naps and increase the amount of time available for sleep</li> <li>Keep the lights bright at work</li> <li>Limit shift changes so your body clock can adjust</li> <li>Limit caffeine use to the first part of your shift</li> <li>Remove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example, use light-blocking curtains)</li> </ul>"

Find out what you can do to control it.","<h3>What is blood pressure?</h3> <p>Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.</p> <p>Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.</p> <h3>How is high blood pressure diagnosed?</h3> <p>High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. He or she will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.</p> <p>You have high blood pressure if your readings show that</p> <ul> <li>Your systolic is 140 or higher <strong>OR</strong></li> <li>Your diastolic is 90 or higher</li> </ul> <p>Some providers may consider you to have high blood pressure if you have other heart risk factors and</p> <ul> <li>Your systolic is between 130 and 139 <strong>OR</strong></li> <li>Your diastolic is between 80 and 89</li> </ul> <p>Blood pressure readings above 180 /120 are dangerously high and require immediate medical attention.</p> <p>For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and gender.</p> <h3>What are the different types of high blood pressure?</h3> <p>There are two main types of high blood pressure: primary and secondary high blood pressure.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Primary,</strong> or essential, high blood pressure is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older.</li> <li><strong>Secondary</strong> high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.</li> </ul> <h3>Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure?</h3> <p>When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/heartattack.html'>heart attack</a>, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/stroke.html'>stroke</a>, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html'>heart failure</a>, and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/kidneyfailure.html'>kidney failure</a>.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for high blood pressure?</h3> <p>Treatments for high blood pressure include <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html'>heart-healthy lifestyle changes</a> and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/bloodpressuremedicines.html'>medicines</a>.</p> <p>You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan.

It is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly - at least once a year for most adults, and more often if you have high blood pressure. Take steps, including lifestyle changes, to <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/howtopreventhighbloodpressure.html'>prevent</a> or control high blood pressure.</li><br/> <li><strong>Keep your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control.</strong> High levels of <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterol.html'>cholesterol</a> can clog your arteries and raise your risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack. <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/howtolowercholesterol.html'>Lifestyle changes</a> and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/cholesterolmedicines.html'>medicines</a> (if needed) can lower your cholesterol. Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High levels of <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/triglycerides.html'>triglycerides</a> may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women.</li><br/> <li><strong>Stay at a healthy weight.</strong> Being overweight or having <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/obesity.html'>obesity</a> can increase your risk for heart disease.

It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease.</li><br/> <li><strong>Limit alcohol.</strong> Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks per day, and women should not have more than one.</li><br/> <li><strong>Don't smoke.</strong> Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, do not start. If you do smoke, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/quittingsmoking.html'>quitting</a> will lower your risk for heart disease.

It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a ""trigger"" for a heart attack. Also, some common ways of coping with stress, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.</li><br/> <li><strong>Manage diabetes.</strong> Having <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/diabetes.html'>diabetes</a> doubles your risk of <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticheartdisease.html'>diabetic heart disease</a>. That is because over time, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/bloodsugar.html'>high blood sugar</a> from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So, it is important to get tested for diabetes, and if you have it, to keep it under control.</li><br/> <li><strong>Make sure that you get enough sleep.</strong> If you don't get enough sleep, you raise your risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk for heart disease. Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. Make sure that you have <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/healthysleep.html'>good sleep habits</a>. If you have frequent sleep problems, contact your health care provider.

Learn more about lupus symptoms and how to cope.","<h3>What is lupus?</h3> <p>Lupus is an <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html'>autoimmune disease</a>. This means that your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This can damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels, and brain.</p> <p>There are several kinds of lupus</p> <ul> <li>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe, and can affect many parts of the body.</li> <li>Discoid lupus causes a red rash that doesn't go away</li> <li>Subacute cutaneous lupus causes sores after being out in the sun</li> <li>Drug-induced lupus is caused by certain medicines. It usually goes away when you stop taking the medicine.</li> <li>Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is probably caused by certain antibodies from the mother.</li> </ul> <h3>Who gets lupus?</h3> <p>Anyone can get lupus, but women are most at risk. Lupus is two to three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women. It's also more common in Hispanic, Asian, and Native American women. African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.</p> <h3>What causes lupus?</h3> <p>The cause of lupus is not known.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of lupus?</h3> <p>Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are</p> <ul> <li>Pain or swelling in joints</li> <li>Muscle pain</li> <li>Fever with no known cause</li> <li>Red rashes, most often on the face (also called the ""butterfly rash"")</li> <li>Chest pain when taking a deep breath</li> <li>Hair loss</li> <li>Pale or purple fingers or toes</li> <li>Sensitivity to the sun</li> <li>Swelling in legs or around eyes</li> <li>Mouth ulcers</li> <li>Swollen glands</li> <li>Feeling very tired</li> </ul> <p>Symptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare. Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.</p> <h3>How do I know if I have lupus?</h3> <p>There is no single test to diagnose lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases. So it may take months or years for a doctor to diagnose it. Your doctor may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</p> <ul> <li>Medical history</li> <li>Complete exam</li> <li>Blood tests</li> <li>Skin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)</li> <li>Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)</li> </ul> <h3>What are the treatments for lupus?</h3> <p>There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.</p> <p>People with lupus often need to see different doctors. You will have a primary care doctor and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in the diseases of joints and muscles). Which other specialists you see depends on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus damages your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist.</p> <p>Your primary care doctor should coordinate care between your different health care providers and treat other problems as they come up. Your doctor will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You and your doctor should review the plan often to be sure it is working. You should report new symptoms to your doctor right away so that your treatment plan can be changed if needed.</p> <p>The goals of the treatment plan are to</p> <ul> <li>Prevent flares</li> <li>Treat flares when they occur</li> <li>Reduce organ damage and other problems</li> </ul> <p>Treatments may include drugs to</p> <ul> <li>Reduce swelling and pain</li> <li>Prevent or reduce flares</li> <li>Help the immune system</li> <li>Reduce or prevent damage to joints</li> <li>Balance the hormones</li> </ul> <p>Besides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.</p> <p>Alternative treatments are those that are not part of standard treatment. At this time, no research shows that alternative medicine can treat lupus. Some alternative or complementary approaches may help you cope or reduce some of the stress associated with living with a chronic illness. You should talk to your doctor before trying any alternative treatments.</p> <h3>How can I cope with lupus?</h3> <p>It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.</p> <p>It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus.

When the mitochondria are defective, the cells do not have enough energy. The unused oxygen and fuel molecules build up in the cells and cause damage.</p> <p>The symptoms of mitochondrial disease can vary. It depends on how many mitochondria are defective, and where they are in the body. Sometimes only one organ, tissue, or cell type is affected. But often the problem affects many of them. Muscle and nerve cells have especially high energy needs, so muscular and neurological problems are common. The diseases range from mild to severe. Some types can be fatal.</p> <p>Genetic mutations cause these diseases. They usually happen before age 20, and some are more common in infants. There are no cures for these diseases, but treatments may help with symptoms and slow down the disease. They may include physical therapy, vitamins and supplements, special diets, and medicines.</p>"

But not all medicines are safe during pregnancy. Many medicines carry risks for you, your baby, or both. Opioids, especially when misused, can cause problems for you and your baby while you are pregnant.</p> <h3>What are opioids?</h3> <p>Opioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/painrelievers.html'>pain relievers</a>, such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.</p> <p>A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some health care providers prescribe them for <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/chronicpain.html'>chronic pain</a>.</p> <p>Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your health care provider. However, opioid dependence, <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/opioidabuseandaddiction.html'>addiction</a>, and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/opioidoverdose.html'>overdose</a> are still potential risks.

Learn about the causes, and how to treat the symptoms and complications.","<h3>What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?</h3> <p>Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40.</p> <p>Many women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.</p> <p>POI is different from premature <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/menopause.html'>menopause</a>. With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant. In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown.</p> <h3>What are the risk factors for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?</h3> <p>Certain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Family history.</strong> Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it.</li> <li><strong>Genes.</strong> Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/fragilexsyndrome.html'>Fragile X syndrome</a> or <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/turnersyndrome.html'>Turner syndrome</a> are at higher risk.</li> <li><strong>Certain diseases,</strong> such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html'>autoimmune diseases</a> and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/viralinfections.html'>viral infections</a></li> <li><strong>Cancer treatments,</strong> such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/cancerchemotherapy.html'>chemotherapy</a> and <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/radiationtherapy.html'>radiation therapy</a></li> <li><strong>Age.</strong> Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40.</li> </ul> <h3>What causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)?</h3> <p>In about 90 percent of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown.</p> <p>Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown.

This can raise your risk of shingles.</p> <p>It is rare, but possible, to get shingles more than once.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of shingles?</h3> <p>Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching. It is usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe.</p> <p>One to 14 days later, you will get a rash. It consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days. The rash is usually a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash occurs on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread and look similar to a chickenpox rash.</p> <p>Some people may also have other symptoms:</p> <ul> <li>Fever</li> <li>Headache</li> <li>Chills</li> <li>Upset stomach</li> </ul> <h3>What are the complications of shingles?</h3> <p>Shingles can cause complications:</p> <ul> <li>Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is most common complication of shingles.

In some cases, your provider may scrap off tissue from the rash or swab some fluid from the blisters and send the sample to a lab for testing.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for shingles?</h3> <p>There is no cure for shingles. Antiviral medicines may help to make the attack shorter and less severe. They may also help prevent PHN. The medicines are most effective if you can take them within 3 days after the rash appears. So if you think you might have shingles, contact your health care provider as soon as possible.</p> <p>Pain relievers may also help with the pain. A cool washcloth, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths may help relieve some of the itching.</p> <h3>Can shingles be prevented?</h3> <p>There are vaccines to prevent shingles or lessen its effects. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get the Shingrix vaccine. You need two doses of the vaccine, given 2 to 6 months apart. Another vaccine, Zostavax, may be used in certain cases.</p>"

"402","Sickle Cell Disease","Sickle cell disease (or sickle cell anemia) causes your body to produce abnormally shaped red blood cells. Learn about symptoms and treatment.","<h3>What is sickle cell disease?</h3> <p>Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but this changes them into a crescent, or sickle, shape.</p> <p>The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/anemia.html'>anemia</a>, and it can make you feel tired.</p> <p>The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment.</p> <h3>What causes sickle cell disease?</h3> <p>The cause of SCD is a defective gene, called a sickle cell gene. People with the disease are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.</p> <p>If you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.</p> <h3>Who gets sickle cell disease?</h3> <p>In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans:</p> <ul> <li>About 1 in 13 African American babies is born with sickle cell trait</li> <li>About 1 in every 365 black children is born with sickle cell disease</li> </ul> <p>SCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease?</h3> <p>People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include</p> <ul> <li>Painful swelling of the hands and feet</li> <li>Fatigue or fussiness from anemia</li> <li>A yellowish color of the skin (<a href='https://medlineplus.gov/jaundice.html'>jaundice</a>) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)</li> </ul> <p>The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections.</p> <h3>How is sickle cell disease diagnosed?</h3> <p>A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. All states now test newborns as part of their screening programs, so treatment can begin early.</p> <p>People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.</p> <p>Doctors can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).</p> <h3>What are the treatments for sickle cell disease?</h3> <p>The only cure for SCD is <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/bonemarrowtransplantation.html'>bone marrow</a> or <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/stemcells.html'>stem cell</a> transplantation. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match.

Along with the <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/adenoids.html'>adenoids</a>, tonsils are part of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance. Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.</p> <h3>What is tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen.</p> <h3>What causes tonsillitis?</h3> <p>The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/streptococcalinfections.html'>strep throat</a> can also cause tonsillitis.</p> <h3>Who gets tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.</p> <p>Adults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common.</p> <h3>Is tonsillitis contagious?</h3> <p>Although tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/germsandhygiene.html'>Frequent handwashing</a> can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of tonsillitis?</h3> <p>The symptoms of tonsillitis include</p> <ul> <li>A <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sorethroat.html'>sore throat</a>, which may be severe</li> <li>Red, swollen tonsils</li> <li>Trouble swallowing</li> <li>A white or yellow coating on the tonsils</li> <li>Swollen glands in the neck</li> <li>Fever</li> <li>Bad breath</li> </ul> <h3>When should I get medical help for my child?</h3> <p>You should call your health care provider if your child</p> <ul> <li>Has a sore throat for more than two days</li> <li>Has trouble or pain when swallowing</li> <li>Feels very sick or very weak</li> </ul> <p>You should get emergency care right away if your child</p> <ul> <li>Has trouble breathing</li> <li>Starts drooling</li> <li>Has a lot of trouble swallowing</li> </ul> <h3>How is tonsillitis diagnosed?</h3> <p>To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.</p> <p>Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for tonsillitis?</h3> <p>Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html'>antibiotics</a>.

It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis, and they have different causes, symptoms, and treatments.</p> <h3>What are the different causes of vaginitis?</h3> <p>Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the ""good"" and ""harmful"" bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria, including</p> <ul> <li>Taking antibiotics</li> <li>Douching</li> <li>Using an intrauterine device (IUD)</li> <li>Having unprotected sex with a new partner</li> <li>Having many sexual partners</li> </ul> <p><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/yeastinfections.html'>Yeast infections</a> (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because of</p> <ul> <li>Antibiotics</li> <li>Pregnancy</li> <li>Diabetes, especially if it is not well-controlled</li> <li>Corticosteroid medicines</li> </ul> <p><a href='https://medlineplus.gov/trichomoniasis.html'>Trichomoniasis</a> can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted disease. It is caused by a parasite.</p> <p>You can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. They can cause burning, itching, and discharge.</p> <p>Hormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or when you have gone through menopause.</p> <p>Sometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time.</p> <h3>What are the symptoms of vaginitis?</h3> <p>The symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have.</p> <p>With BV, you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor, such as a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex.</p> <p>Yeast infections produce a thick, white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red.</p> <p>You may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them, they include itching, burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge, which may smell bad.</p> <h3>How is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed?</h3> <p>To find out the cause of your symptoms, your health care provider may</p> <ul> <li>Ask you about your health history</li> <li>Do a pelvic exam</li> <li>Look for vaginal discharge, noting its color, qualities, and any odor</li> <li>Study a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope</li> </ul> <p>In some cases, you may need more tests.</p> <h3>What are the treatments for vaginitis?</h3> <p>The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have.</p> <p>BV is treatable with <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/antibiotics.html'>antibiotics</a>. You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all.</p> <p>Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment.</p> <p>The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again.</p> <p>If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product.</p> <p>If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms.</p> <h3>Can vaginitis cause other health problems?</h3> <p>It is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis, because having either of them can increase your risk for getting <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/hivaids.html'>HIV</a> or another <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/sexuallytransmitteddiseases.html'>sexually transmitted disease</a>. If you are pregnant, BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk for <a href='https://medlineplus.gov/pretermlabor.html'>preterm labor</a> and preterm birth.</p> <h3>How can I prevent vaginitis?</h3> <p>To help prevent vaginitis</p> <ul> <li>Do not douche or use vaginal sprays</li> <li>Use a condom when having sex</li> <li>Avoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture</li> <li>Wear cotton underwear</li> </ul>"
